# SHEMMAN soft rotator nuclear structure code
This repository contains the soft rotator nuclear structure code SHEMMAN. The code performs 
calculations of level energies and gamma-transition probabilities within the soft rotator model.
Hamiltonian parameters can be fitted using experimental level energies.

## Usage

'shemman <inputfile> <outputfile>'
